Wolf Framework
=========

**Wolf Framework** will be the name of the structure I'm going to create. You can also call it : **Wolf, or Wolfy.**
This is the repository for the creation of a homemade framework which will be used for our personal website : **Meetoparty**. This is a free project. I'm making this sturcture open-source, so you can use it for all the projects you want, but that would be great if you still continue to improve this structure by opening some issues, or advices...
There is some **rules** you need to follow, to be able to build a good framework. Every day, some new rules will be added to the project.
To follow the progress of the work here is the link of the **specifications** :

Authors
--------------

The main author of this structure is : Quentin LOZACH, and he will be help by his friend on the project : Nicolas DEIXONNE. Other poeple will be able to join the project later to create the same structure in another langage for example : Ruby, Python, Java ...

Rules
=========

This is a list of rules and convention I'm going to follow on this project, and I hope that if people are going to code with me, it will be the same for everyone.

1. - Don't commit directly on the master before to be sure that your code is working, except if you are fixing a major bug directly on the master. The master branch will be the main one with the current running application and the last working version.
