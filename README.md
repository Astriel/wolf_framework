Wolf Framework
=========

Wolf Framework will be the name of the structure I'm going to create. You can also call it : Wolf, or Wolfy.

This is the repository for the creation of a homemade framework which will be used for our personal website : Meetoparty. This is a free project. I'm making this sturcture open-source, so you can use it for all the projects you want, but that would be great if you still continue to improve this structure by opening some issues, or advices...

Authors
=========

The main author of this structure is : Quentin LOZACH, and I'll be help by my friend on the project : Nicolas DEIXONNE.

Rules
=========

This is a list of rules and convention I'm going to follow on this project, and I hope that if people are going to code with me, it will be the same for everyone.

Rules - Github
=========

1. Don't commit directly on the master before to be sure that your code is working, except if you are fixing a major bug directly on the master. The master branch will be the main one with the current running application and the last working version.
